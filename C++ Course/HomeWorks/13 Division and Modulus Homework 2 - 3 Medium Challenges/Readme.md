  - 125 ⇒ 8
  - 1000 ⇒ 0
  - 1001 ⇒ 1
  - 1234 ⇒ 9
  - 99999 ⇒ 27

## Problem #3: 4th digits from the end

- Write a program that reads an integer and print the 4th from the right side. If
  no such digit, print 0
- Inputs => outputs
  - 15 => 0
  - 125 => 0
  - 1000 => 1
  - 5001 => 5
  - 1234 => 1
  - 654321 => 4
