## Problem #1: Find Maximum of 10

- Read 10 integers, find which of them has the biggest value and print it.
- Inputs
  - 1 67 -9 88 -45 129 90 65 77 34 ⇒ 129
- Restriction: In your whole code there should be 2 integer variables defined
  ONLY
  - If it is hard constraint; code it in whatever way

## Problem #2: Find Maximum up to 10

- Read an integer N (2 <= N <= 10)
- Then read N integers, find which of them has the biggest value and print it.
- Inputs
  - 5 1 3 2 4 2 ⇒ 4
    - 5 means read 5 integers
    - Then we read them [1 3 2 4 2]. Their maximum is 4
  - 10 1 67 -9 88 -45 129 90 65 77 34 ⇒ 129
    - Same as last homework. This time we are given first N (10)
